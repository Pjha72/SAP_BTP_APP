# SAP BTP Application Development with RAP Model

This repository provides the steps to create an SAP BTP Application using the **RAP (RESTful ABAP Programming) Model**. Follow the instructions below to build and deploy your application.

---

## Steps for Creation

### Step 1: Create Database Table
Define the database table in the ABAP Dictionary to store your application's data. Ensure it contains all the required fields and configurations (e.g., primary keys, data types).

---

### Step 2: Create Interface View
Create an **interface view** that reads data from the database table. This view serves as the foundation for other layers and ensures abstraction of the database structure.

---

### Step 3: Create Consumption/Projection View
Define a **consumption view** (or projection view) that reads data from the interface view. This view is exposed to the frontend and users.

---

### Step 4: Create Metadata Extension File
Enhance the consumption view by creating a **Metadata Extension** file. Use this file to define the UI annotations for fields, labels, and other presentation settings.

---

### Step 5: Create Behavior Definition
Define the **Behavior Definition** for both the interface and consumption views. Specify:
- The actions and operations (e.g., create, update, delete, read).
- Key features such as draft handling, validations, or determinations.

---

### Step 6: Create Behavior Implementation
Implement the business logic for the application in the **Behavior Pool Class** linked to the interface view. This includes writing the logic for validations, determinations, and other custom operations.

---

### Step 7: Create Service Definition
Create a **Service Definition** to expose the data model and functionality to external consumers. The name of the service definition should match the application.

---

### Step 8: Create Service Binding
Create a **Service Binding** to enable the service definition. This step allows you to configure the service type (OData V2/V4) and activate it for consumption.

---

### Step 9: Publish
Publish the service binding to make your application available for consumption on SAP BTP. Test the service endpoints to ensure everything works as expected.

---

## Additional Notes
- Ensure you follow SAP best practices while implementing behavior logic and designing database tables.
- Use the appropriate SAP tools (e.g., ADT, Eclipse) for development.
- Test each step thoroughly to avoid issues during deployment.

Happy Coding! ðŸŽ‰
